      <description>Reaching space is both expensive and challenging. By cultivating a broader interest in the potential of space data, we can ensure the economic viability of this sector and set the stage for even more ambitious explorations.
At p.Maricopa, our mission is twofold: on one hand, we support companies that operate spacecraft, helping them make their collected data accessible to everyone and enabling them to profit from their investments while sustaining their development.</description>
